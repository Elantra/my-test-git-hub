Just a test using instructions.
I am a space traveler (yeah, that sounds believable!) that comes from a close planet to Earth because I like to watch other beings from a scientific point of view. I document what they do for a living. Only that. That is kind of an expertise in my planet. I draw statistics and conclusions, then I project that information a thousand years ahead for those communities, correcting for cultural differences.
